- GitHub remote name: `origin`
- GitHub remote URL: `git@github.com:Gaia-Digital-Agency/ascortbali_live.git` (this is the production tree; the older `ascortbali_staging` repo is no longer the source of truth)

## Overview

Baligirls is a multi-role web application served from the domain root in production. It is an online marketplace connecting creators (service providers) with users, featuring admin CMS management, image uploads, and WhatsApp-based two-factor authentication.

Primary stack:

- **React + Vite SPA** in `app/web-vite` (production frontend on port 8002)
  - Vite builds a static SPA into `dist/client/`. The Express server in `server.ts` serves the build via `express.static` + an `index.html` SPA fallback. **No SSR is performed** — the React tree is hydrated entirely in the browser.
  - The same Express server also handles GCS-backed image routes (`/api/upload`, `/api/uploads`, `/api/admin-asset`, `/api/clean-image`, `/api/static`) and `/sitemap.xml`.
- Express API in `app/api` (port 8001) — uses Prisma client (raw `$queryRawUnsafe` for the legacy `providers/app_accounts/…` tables; typed Prisma for newer tables like `Service`)
- PostgreSQL 18.3 (PG16 rollback cluster preserved on port 5433)
- Google Cloud Storage for media — authenticated via a service-account JSON key (`/etc/gda-credentials/gda-viceroy-17373de6d690.json`, mode 600). The VM's default compute service account is read-only-scoped, so a key file with `storage.objectAdmin` on the bucket is required for uploads/deletes.
- Twilio for WhatsApp 2FA — **currently disabled** in production (`WHATSAPP_2FA_ENABLED=false`)
- nginx serves `/assets/*` (Vite-hashed, immutable, 1-year cache) directly from `dist/client/assets/` and proxies the rest to the Node processes
- PM2 + nginx on the production VM (`gda-pn01`)
- pnpm monorepo (single workspace glob: `app/*`)

> **Note:** A legacy Next.js 14 implementation lived in `app/web` (deleted on 2026-04-29). The frontend migrated to Vite SPA on 2026-04-15. Use `app/web-vite` for all new frontend work.

## Recent Changes (May 2026 migration)

The app moved from `gda-ce01` (`baligirls.gaiada1.online`) to `gda-pn01` (`baligirls.gaiada2.online`) on 2026-05-06/07. Notable changes captured in the cutover:

**Infrastructure**
- New host: `gda-pn01` (GCE, external `34.2.143.47`, internal `10.148.0.9`).
- Dedicated nginx vhost at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/baligirls` with its own Let's Encrypt cert.
- GCS auth switched from default-compute-SA (read-only) to a service-account JSON key (`/etc/gda-credentials/gda-viceroy-17373de6d690.json`) — uploads + deletes now work end-to-end.
- 2FA env-parser bug fixed: `WHATSAPP_2FA_ENABLED=false` was being silently flipped to `true` by `z.coerce.boolean()`. Replaced with an explicit string-match parser; 2FA is now off in production.
- Sitemap, robots.txt, and `index.html` (`og:url`, `canonical`) now point to `baligirls.gaiada2.online` (`PUBLIC_SITE_URL` overrideable via env).

**UX / product**
- New brand logo + multi-size favicon (256×256 source, retina-clean at 56 px header display).
- Two stacked side ads per side (left = `home-1` + `home-2`, right = `home-3` + `home-4`) on every page that has side ads.
- Top pagination removed from the homepage; bottom pagination retained.
- Site-wide button hover states reworked (no more clipping inside `overflow-hidden` containers); custom gold chevron + 2.75 rem right padding on every `<select>`.
- Creator card NAME strip is now a fixed-height (44 px) row that always vertically centers correctly.

**Creator / public profile**
- New field: **WeChat ID** (added via creator registration → profile → public view; stored in `providers.wechat_id`).
- Public profile DETAILS now split into two zones with a visible separator:
  - **Profile info** — visible to everyone (guests included).
  - **Contact** — last four rows (Phone/SMS, Whatsapp, Telegram, WeChat ID), always rendered (em-dash if empty), blurred for guests with a MEMBERS ONLY overlay.
- Image gallery + feature image are now visible to guests (only contacts gated).

**Creator profile management page**
- `NOTES` field renamed to `ABOUT ME` (DB column unchanged).
- `CITY` text input replaced by a multi-area **SERVICE AREA** checklist popover (All Bali / Ubud / Seminyak / Canggu / Nusa Dua / Sanur / Kuta / Denpasar / Jimbaran / Uluwatu / Legian / Tabanan / Pererenan / Bukit / Gianyar). Stored comma-separated in the existing `providers.city` column (max bumped from 50 → 500 chars).
- `COUNTRY` field removed from the editor (DB column kept; API now treats it as optional).
- Gender choices restricted to **Female / Transgender** (matches registration). Existing rows with other values aren't broken.

**Creator registration page**
- Gender choices: **Female / Transgender** only (Male and Undisclosed removed).
- `HAIR LENGTH` and `SERVICES` fields removed entirely — those live in the profile editor only.
- Contact fields: Phone/SMS (required) + Whatsapp (required, used for 2FA when enabled) + Telegram (optional) + WeChat ID (optional).

**Repo / source control**
- Source canonical repo is now `git@github.com:Gaia-Digital-Agency/ascortbali_live.git` — first commit landed on `main` on 2026-05-07.
- Production checkout on `gda-pn01` lives at `/var/www/baligirls/` (deployment target). The clone for git operations lives at `/home/azlan/repos/ascortbali_live/`.

- **Homepage Tagline**: editable text shown on homepage
- **Featured Girls Carousel**: select 4 active creators by name from dropdown

  - CLOSE button (white, visible)
  - EDIT mode makes all fields editable
  - DELETE has inline confirmation ("Are you sure?")
  - Creator delete is soft delete (deactivates, moves to Inactive)
- Password change

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth with Ed25519 keys (access + refresh tokens)
- Login via email + password for all portals
- User and creator can change their login email
- Forgot password: verify identity with 2 matching fields, then reset
- Bcrypt password hashing (auto-upgrades legacy plaintext on login)

### WhatsApp 2FA (Optional)
- Production currently has it **disabled** (`WHATSAPP_2FA_ENABLED=false` in `app/api/.env`).
- When enabled, sends 6-digit OTP via WhatsApp (Twilio) after password validation, OTP expires in 5 minutes, max 5 attempts.
- Resend code and back-to-login options on verification screen. Graceful fallback: if WhatsApp send fails, login proceeds normally.
- Applies to all portals when account has a WhatsApp number.
- Setup guide: `twilio_auth_guide.md`.
- **Important**: the env parser in `app/api/src/lib/env.ts` parses this as an explicit string match (`"true"` / `"1"` / `"yes"` / `"on"`). Earlier `z.coerce.boolean()` was treating `"false"` as `true` (because `Boolean("false") === true`); that bug was fixed on 2026-05-07. To re-enable 2FA, set `WHATSAPP_2FA_ENABLED=true` and `pm2 restart baligirls-api`.

API endpoints:
- `POST /auth/2fa/verify` — submit OTP code
- `POST /auth/2fa/resend` — resend OTP

Environment variables (in `app/api/.env`):
```
WHATSAPP_2FA_ENABLED=false   # set to "true" to re-enable
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM=whatsapp:+14155238886
```

## Repo Notes

- Production host: `gda-pn01` (GCE) — external `34.2.143.47`, internal `10.148.0.9`
- Internal web port: `8002` (Vite SPA + Express server, active)
- Internal API port: `8001`
- Legacy Next.js (`baligirls-web`, port `3001`) is not deployed on this server
- HTTPS: served via nginx at `https://baligirls.gaiada2.online` (config: `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/baligirls`, dedicated per-host file)
- TLS: dedicated Let's Encrypt cert at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/baligirls.gaiada2.online/` (Certbot-managed, auto-renew via systemd timer)
- Co-tenants on this VM: `essentialbali`, `essentialbali-cms`, `essentialbali-daily-feed`, `schoolcatering-api`, `schoolcatering-web` (separate apps, unrelated processes)
- Monorepo workspaces: `app/*` (single glob in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- Root scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`
- Some internal identifiers still use legacy `ascortbali` naming (package names in `app/api` like `@ascortbali/api`, database name `ascortbali`). The GitHub repo slug is now `ascortbali_live`.

## PM2 Processes

| Process | Description | Port | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `baligirls-web-vite` | Vite SSR + Express server (production web) | 8002 | online |
| `baligirls-api` | Express API | 8001 | online |

## Maintenance Mode

Take the public site offline (e.g. for a risky deploy) without stopping any
process or breaking SEO. nginx returns `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable`
with `Retry-After: 3600` and a brand-styled "Back Shortly" page; search
engines treat this as temporary and do not deindex.

A small allow-list of IPs (currently `194.5.82.35` for the operator and
`127.0.0.1` for on-server checks) bypasses the gate and sees the live site,
so you can verify changes during the maintenance window.

```sh
# Take baligirls offline (everyone except the bypass list sees 503)
ssh gda-pn01
touch /var/www/baligirls/maintenance/.on

# Bring it back
rm /var/www/baligirls/maintenance/.on
```

No `nginx -s reload` needed — the file-existence test runs per request.
Both commands are idempotent (running them twice is harmless).

Verify externally with `curl -sI https://baligirls.gaiada2.online/ | head -1`
— `503` while gated, `200` once cleared.

Implementation:

- nginx vhost: `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/baligirls` — maintenance block at
  the top of the HTTPS server, scoped to baligirls only (other vhosts on
  `gda-pn01` are unaffected).
- Maintenance HTML: `/var/www/baligirls/maintenance/index.html` (fully
  inline CSS — no asset dependencies, so it renders even though /assets
  also returns 503 during the window).
- Vhost backups: `/etc/nginx/baligirls-backups/`.
- To add another bypass IP, edit `if ($remote_addr = "...")` in the vhost
  and `sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

## GCP Storage Uploads

- Upload storage uses Google Cloud Storage
- Bucket: `gda-ce01-bucket`
- Upload prefix: `baligirls/uploads`
- Ads upload path: `baligirls/ads`
- Auth: **service-account JSON key** at `/etc/gda-credentials/gda-viceroy-17373de6d690.json` (mode 600, owned by `azlan`). The VM's default compute SA on `gda-pn01` only has `devstorage.read_only` scope, which fails uploads with `Provided scope(s) are not authorized`; the SA from the key file has `storage.objectAdmin` on the bucket and is what the Storage client uses. Set via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` in `app/web-vite/.env` (and add to `app/api/.env` if/when the API also needs to write to GCS, e.g. for delete-on-image-removal).
- Runtime env (set in `app/web-vite/.env`):
  - `GCS_BUCKET_NAME=gda-ce01-bucket` (bucket name retained from old VM — name is just an identifier, no need to rename post-migration)
  - `GCS_UPLOAD_PREFIX=baligirls/uploads`
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/gda-credentials/gda-viceroy-17373de6d690.json`
- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/upload` (proxied by nginx to web-vite, not the API)
- Uploaded file retrieval: `GET /api/uploads/<object-key>` (also served by web-vite)
- Other GCS-backed routes proxied to web-vite: `/api/admin-asset`, `/api/clean-image`

## Database

- PostgreSQL **18.3** on `localhost:5432`, database: `ascortbali`
- A PG **16** cluster is preserved on `localhost:5433` as a rollback target (not used by the app)
- Key tables:
  - `app_accounts` — user/admin accounts (id, role, username, password, phone, whatsapp)
  - `user_profiles` — user profile data (linked to app_accounts)
  - `providers` — creator accounts and full profile data
  - `provider_images` — creator image slots (20 per creator)
  - `advertising_spaces` — ad slots (home-1 through home-4, bottom)

## Production Health Audit (2026-05-07)

### Service Status — ✅ All Healthy

| Endpoint | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `https://baligirls.gaiada2.online/` | 200 |
| `https://baligirls.gaiada2.online/api/ads` | 200 |
| `https://baligirls.gaiada2.online/api/creators?page=1&limit=5` | 200 |

### PM2 Process Manager — Running

PM2 is managed via systemd unit `pm2-azlan.service` (User=`azlan`, `PM2_HOME=/home/azlan/.pm2`). Resurrect file: `/home/azlan/.pm2/dump.pm2`.

Live PM2 list (this VM):

| ID | Name | Mode | Instances | PID | Restarts | Status |
|----|------|------|-----------|-----|----------|--------|
| 0 | schoolcatering-web | fork | 1 | 1232 | 0 | online |
| 1 | schoolcatering-api | fork | 1 | 1238 | 0 | online |
| 2 | baligirls-web-vite | fork | 1 | 61997 | 7 | online |
| 3 | baligirls-api | cluster | (worker 1) | 1244 | 0 | online |
| 4 | baligirls-api | cluster | (worker 2) | 1254 | 0 | online |

Notes:
- `baligirls-api` runs in **cluster mode with 2 workers** (PIDs 1244, 1254) for horizontal CPU usage / zero-downtime reload
- `baligirls-web-vite` runs in **fork mode** (single process), launched via `tsx --env-file=.env server.ts` (CWD: `app/web-vite`)
- Process owner is **`azlan`** (not `www-data`) — file ownership in `/var/www/baligirls/` is therefore `azlan:www-data`
- No `ecosystem.config.js` at the repo root; PM2 is configured via the in-memory dump (`pm2 save`). To rebuild config-as-code, generate one from current state with `pm2 ecosystem` and check it in.
- No cron jobs configured for the app (no scheduled cleanup, no log rotation by app — relies on PM2 internal logs)

### Production Domain — Subdomain Only (no apex domain provisioned)

- The app is reachable at `https://baligirls.gaiada2.online` only — a subdomain of `gaiada2.online`, served from a dedicated nginx server block (`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/baligirls`) with its own Let's Encrypt cert at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/baligirls.gaiada2.online/`.
- A real production domain (e.g. `baligirls.com`) has **not** been provisioned. Specifically:
  - `baligirls.com` resolves to `13.223.25.84` (AWS — unrelated third-party site, not us)
  - `baligirls.id`, `baligirls.co.id`, `baligirlsbali.com` — all NXDOMAIN
- When a production domain is chosen and registered, the cutover will require: (a) DNS A record → `34.2.143.47`, (b) issue a Let's Encrypt cert (DNS-01 or HTTP-01) for the new hostname, (c) new nginx server block (mirror `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/baligirls` with the new `server_name` and cert paths), (d) reload nginx, (e) update `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `app/web-vite/.env` and `og:url`/`canonical` in `app/web-vite/index.html` if the new domain becomes canonical.

The bulk of disk use is `node_modules` (expected for a pnpm monorepo). The `cleanup_engine/` Python toolkit is dev-only and not invoked at runtime — candidate to move out of the production tree if disk pressure ever becomes an issue.

### `cleanup_engine/` — Python Tooling

Not part of the runtime. Used for one-off data ops:

- `build_data.py` — bulk profile data assembly
- `scrape_full_image.py` — image fetcher
- `remove_watermark.py` — watermark removal pipeline
- `page_scrapper/`, `site_scrapper/` — source-site scrapers
- `watermark/` — watermark assets
- `.venv_watermark/` — local Python venv (excluded from runtime)

Requirements: `cleanup_engine/requirements_remove_watermark.txt`.

### Known Discrepancies / Observations

1. **README earlier states "PM2 + nginx"** (line ~24) — confirmed accurate. Both processes are PM2-managed, not raw `node`/`tsx` despite the bare `node`/`tsx` strings visible in `ps aux`. PM2 spawns these directly (cluster fork for the API, single fork for web-vite via bash → tsx).
2. **README claims production frontend on port 8002** — confirmed (Vite SPA + Express).
3. **README mentions both `app/*` and `packages/*` workspaces** — only `app/*` exists in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; no `packages/` directory. README line referencing both should be reconciled.
4. **GitHub repo slug is `ascortbali_live`** as of the May 2026 migration. Internal package names still use the legacy `ascortbali` prefix (`@ascortbali/api`); rename is intentionally deferred to keep imports stable.
5. **`app/api/node_modules` and `app/web-vite/node_modules` are tiny** (124K, 132K) — pnpm hoists deps to root. Don't mistake their small size for a broken install.

### Recovery / Restart Quick Reference

```bash
# Restart everything
sudo -u azlan pm2 restart baligirls-api baligirls-web-vite --update-env
sudo -u azlan pm2 save

# Reload nginx after config change
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload

# View live logs
sudo -u azlan pm2 logs baligirls-api --lines 100
sudo -u azlan pm2 logs baligirls-web-vite --lines 100

# Database connect
sudo -u postgres psql ascortbali
```
